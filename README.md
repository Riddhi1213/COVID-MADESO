# COVID-MADESO
Our main motive, Face mask detection with Social Distancing is the task of identifying that a person wear mask or not and they are walking with maintaining Social Distance to each other.


* As we all know that there is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) which is accelerating day by day , self protection is the only way out which can be done by wearing masks, social distancing and taking precautions.

* So in this era of automation and artificial intelligence we decided to come up with a project that is going to automate the process of desired detection detection using open CV and deep learning.


### Features
- Face Mask Detection 
This platform perceives if a person does/doesn’t wear a mask. The application can be associated with any cameras. 
- Social Distancing detection 
It will detect that two or more persons in a single frame are walking with maintain social distancing. 


### Installation
* To run the project, clone the project,
* Install the packages in requirements.txt
* Download the following files and place it under the folder dist_files:
    * https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg
    * https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights


* Analysis is done using Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm and Flask is used for GUI.
